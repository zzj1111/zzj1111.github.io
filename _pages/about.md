I'm a third year undergraduate student from [School of CS](https://cise.ecust.edu.cn/), [East China University of Science and Technology](https://www.ecust.edu.cn/main.htm). My research interest includes Alignment of Large Languague Model(especially data-efficient alignment), security problems of Large Language Model, and Synthesizing high quality data for LLM.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Yining Li] of OpenMMLab(InternLM team) from [Shanghai Artificial Intelligence Labotatory](https://www.shlab.org.cn/).

You can find my CV here: [Zijian Zhang's Curriculum Vitae](../assets/ZijianZhang_CV.pdf).
