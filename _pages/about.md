I'm looking for 25 Fall Phd program in US (maybe somewhere else, too)! Feel free to contact me via Email and Wechat!

I'm a senior undergraduate student from [School of CS](https://cise.ecust.edu.cn/), [East China University of Science and Technology](https://www.ecust.edu.cn/main.htm). My research interests include alignment for LLM (especially data-efficient alignment) \& Vision-Language-Action models and post-training for embodied AI.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Huaxiu Yao](https://www.huaxiuyao.io/) @ [Huaxiu Yao's Lab](https://www.huaxiuyao.io/) @ University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.  

You can find my CV here: [Zijian Zhang's Curriculum Vitae](../assets/ZijianZhang_CV.pdf).  

You can find my transcript here: [Zijian Zhang's transcript](../assets/ZijianZhang_transcript.pdf).

You can find my SoP here: [Zijian Zhang's SoP](../assets/ZijianZhang_SoP.pdf).
